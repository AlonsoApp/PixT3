This folder contains the evaluation reports and model outputs during development. 
Please note that we use the internal codenames assigned during development to maintain consistency with our project 
reports. To ensure the reports remain accurate, we have not changed these references to the final model names.

These are the codenames for each model:
- **PixT3 (TControl):** `f4__20230918_201309`
- **PixT3 (LControl):** `i1__20230905_134725`
- **PixT3 (OpenE):** `i3__20230905_134649`
- **PixT3 (SLC):** `h1__20230904_120158`
